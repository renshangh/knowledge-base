# qr

# `openclaw qr`

Generate an iOS pairing QR and setup code from your current Gateway configuration.

## Usage

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"min-light","dark":"min-dark"}}
openclaw qr
openclaw qr --setup-code-only
openclaw qr --json
openclaw qr --remote
openclaw qr --url wss://gateway.example/ws
```

## Options

* `--remote`: use `gateway.remote.url` plus remote token/password from config
* `--url <url>`: override gateway URL used in payload
* `--public-url <url>`: override public URL used in payload
* `--token <token>`: override which gateway token the bootstrap flow authenticates against
* `--password <password>`: override which gateway password the bootstrap flow authenticates against
* `--setup-code-only`: print only setup code
* `--no-ascii`: skip ASCII QR rendering
* `--json`: emit JSON (`setupCode`, `gatewayUrl`, `auth`, `urlSource`)

## Notes

* `--token` and `--password` are mutually exclusive.
* The setup code itself now carries an opaque short-lived `bootstrapToken`, not the shared gateway token/password.
* With `--remote`, if effectively active remote credentials are configured as SecretRefs and you do not pass `--token` or `--password`, the command resolves them from the active gateway snapshot. If gateway is unavailable, the command fails fast.
* Without `--remote`, local gateway auth SecretRefs are resolved when no CLI auth override is passed:
  * `gateway.auth.token` resolves when token auth can win (explicit `gateway.auth.mode="token"` or inferred mode where no password source wins).
  * `gateway.auth.password` resolves when password auth can win (explicit `gateway.auth.mode="password"` or inferred mode with no winning token from auth/env).
* If both `gateway.auth.token` and `gateway.auth.password` are configured (including SecretRefs) and `gateway.auth.mode` is unset, setup-code resolution fails until mode is set explicitly.
* Gateway version skew note: this command path requires a gateway that supports `secrets.resolve`; older gateways return an unknown-method error.
* After scanning, approve device pairing with:
  * `openclaw devices list`
  * `openclaw devices approve <requestId>`
